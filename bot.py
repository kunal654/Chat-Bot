Implementing a Basic Interaction for LLM framework powered
BotDesign the conversation flow for the bot with a simple 
flowchart or script of the botâ€™s conversation.Choose an 
LLM framework (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4 or Hugging Face Transformers). 
Implement a basic bot using the chosen framework to handle the 
designed conversation flow. The bot should be able to greet users 
and ask for their name, email, and company. Store the collected information 
in a simple in-memory structure (e.g., a Python dictionary).
